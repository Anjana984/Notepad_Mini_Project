_**Additional Notes**_

Dear Madam,

My name is Anjana Prabhashwara. I am a repeating student and I am currently completing my internship as a Software Engineer at Enterprises Business Intelligence, Just In Time Group, Kollupitiya.

Unfortunately, I was involved in an accident and suffered a broken rib, which prevented me from attending some lectures and completing certain assignments. This has led to me repeating some subjects, including this one. Due to limited leave at work, I have not been able to participate in classes regularly.

Additionally, I misunderstood the submission deadlines, as both projects had the same due date. As a result, my submission for this project is slightly late. I kindly request your consideration of my circumstances and my submission so that I may achieve a pass mark for the subject.

Thank you very much for your understanding.
